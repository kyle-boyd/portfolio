        			<p class="XS bodytext animatesection">Clay is a tool developed for Google allowing Project Executives to more easily plan and develop office renovation projects in-house, and then seamlessly hand-off to their external design teams. As a sort in between spreadsheets and the drawing board of CAD or Revit, there are multiple stages a project can move through, and multiple types of studies a user can create for a project. Clay home is where a user can find metadata about these studies and access their desired work.
        			</p>
                    <p class="XS bodytext animatesection">Clay is an amalgamation of a series of previously disparate applications that are all accomplishing similar work in parallel. Clay is intended to help a variety of users (Project Executives, Project Analysts, architects, interior designers, etc) streamline their collaborative process together.
                    </p>

      		<div class="right-column">
        		<p class="M boldtext sectiontitle animatesection">Initial Discovery</p>
        			<p class="XS bodytext animatesection">The first step for the team was to understand the underlying structure and connections between different studies, and establish boundaries between them. Some of the app structure is based off of pre-existing work, and some new, so there was a lot of discovery involved in how a user should move through the different Clay experiences. I worked very closely with product and engineering in this exploration process.

        		<p class="M boldtext sectiontitle animatesection">Approach</p>
        			<p class="XS bodytext animatesection">The primary goals for this design was to provide an intuitive platform where new users could easily understand how and what they could access, and existing users could quickly find where they left off. As we got further into understanding the boundaries between different states within Clay, it became clear that Google Drive would be a very helpful precedent. Like Drive, Clay has a variety of types of work a user can accomplish. Unlike Drive, the different “files” are interlinked and interdependent.

        			<p class="XS bodytext animatesection">As the first designer specifically on Clay, I worked to bring together the work that other designers were working on previously disconnected applications. We developed a language of Projects and Studies to organize the work, and establish boundaries between different aspects of the programming, designing, and financial planning.

        		<p class="M boldtext sectiontitle animatesection">Search</p>
        			<p class="XS bodytext animatesection">In addition to simple navigation, the search feature is a valuable tool that allows a user to quickly find what they want to work with by searching based on a variety of parameters. Including some visual cues about metadata for search results also allows a user to more quickly key in on their desired study or project.

        			<p class="XS bodytext animatesection">Allowing users to see work progress and go back in time if needed gives users confidence to make changes and test different ideas. Again, I heavily referred to Google Drive (especially Docs) as a driving model. Users can flip back through to quickly see changes, and have an indication of where changes were made.
